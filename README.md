# ctraft 

![preview](https://github.com/kejran/ctraft/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

A simple proof-of-concept, barebones minecraft engine clone running on Nintendo 3DS. Written mostly as a practice while learning `libctru` & `citro3d`. 

### How do you pronounce _ctraft_?
You do not.

## Specifics
`ctraft` uses simplex noise to generate a basic terrain split into 16Â³ chunks, which are separately triangulated into meshes. 

Currently, terrain surface is generated from a 2d simplex heightmap. Ore is placed below, based on a 3d noise density, while caves are carved on string intersections of two simplex 3d isosurfaces. Above the surface, grass and trees are generated depending on a basic hash values. 

Chunk generation and meshing are serviced asynchronously on a separate thread. Old 3ds only has a 30% timeslice available on the second core, so New3DS is recommended. 

Currently no mesh optimization is being done, although vertex data is shared between faces.

There is no proper light support - but a simple static, vertex-based ambient occlusion is being generated during meshing.
